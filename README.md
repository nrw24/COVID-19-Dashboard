# COVID-19-Dashboard
This website was created using Python, XML DOM API, HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MYSQL and Bash scripting. During the corona pandemic, I found it useful to try to create a comprehensive dashboard on national and state statistics. The site also includes some homepage customization options such as selecting a highlight state and/or a set of favorite states to display.
